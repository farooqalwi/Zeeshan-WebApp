<h1>تاریخ پاکستان</h1>
TThe history of Pakistan encompasses the region of the Indus Valley,[1][2][3][4] which spans the western expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern Iranian plateau.[5] The region served both as the fertile ground of a major civilisation and as the gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East.[6][7]

Situated on the first coastal migration route of Homo sapiens out of Africa, the region was inhabited early by modern humans.[8][9] The 9,000-year history of village life in South Asia traces back to the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan,[10][11][12] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.[13][14]
